Your icon layout is fully customizable with the variety of options configurable in the settings pane.

If you aren't the creative type or don't want to be bothered with testing each setting, there are presets available for you to choose from. You can align you icons in the the top half of the screen or the bottom half or even the top corners of the screen. Anything is really possible.Boxy also allows for more space for Dashboard X widgets. You no longer have to compromise with which apps you want on the home page of your SpringBoard, you can now have all of them on the screen plus your favorite widgets!
